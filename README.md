# Houston-FVI

This documentation describes a process for creating a flood vulnerability index (FVI) for Houston, Texas. The index is created through the application of a principal component analysis (PCA) and dasymetric mapping. For the purpose of this analysis, flood vulnerability is defined as a combination of physical and social factors which could result in disproportionate suffering and prolonged recovery in the event of a major flood. This analysis assesses flood vulnerability through three main factors: flood risk, shelter accessibility, and social justice. The respective scores for each of these factors are assigned weights according to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and combined for a final FVI score, on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being the lowest vulnerability score and 100 being the highest. This analysis was developed into two different Python scripts, one addressing the social justice/statistical element, and the other performing the dasymetric analysis for flood risk and shelter accessibility. The inputs, processes, and purposes of both scripts, as well as the weight calculation through AHP are described below.
