# Houston-FVI

This documentation describes a process for creating a flood vulnerability index (FVI) for Houston, Texas. The index is created through the application of a principal component analysis (PCA) and dasymetric mapping. For the purpose of this analysis, flood vulnerability is defined as a combination of physical and social factors which could result in disproportionate suffering and prolonged recovery in the event of a major flood. This analysis assesses flood vulnerability through three main factors: flood risk, shelter accessibility, and social justice. The respective scores for each of these factors are assigned weights according to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and combined for a final FVI score, on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being the lowest vulnerability score and 100 being the highest. This analysis was developed into two different Python scripts, one addressing the social justice/statistical element, and the other performing the dasymetric analysis for flood risk and shelter accessibility. The inputs, processes, and purposes of both scripts, as well as the weight calculation through AHP are described below.

<b> Principal Component Analysis </b>

Multicollinearity is a common issue faced in multiple regression analyses such as this one. variables which are independent of each other could still be highly correlated with each other, and when several variables are correlated with several other variables, then the dataset could be said to contain high multicollinearity. This can inflate the value of certain variables and severely skew analysis results. PCA is a method for accounting for this problem. Through PCA, variance within a dataset is increased, and new <b>components</b>, which are composites of all of the input variables are created.
